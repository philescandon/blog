        "I completed the first video and purchased the book. I couldn't complete the binder section of the first lesson.  I installed voila and posted my notebook to my github but couldn't get the notebook to post in binder.  I tried for a bit to get it working - but some of these items are rabbit holes for me - I could easily spend the afternoon trying to get binder, voila and github to play nice, but I'm trying to learn about neural networks not deploying to binder.\r\n",

        "The important parts were completed.  I did try to expand on the model - by creating model that could distinguish a meteor in the night sky.  After I collected many images of the night sky as well as meteors - all i can say is that Bing Image Search is crap.  My initial model was crap mainly because the data was crap. But after a lot of cleaning, deleting, relabeling the experimenting I could only get the model to an accuracy of about 70%.  Not good.\r\n",

The material..is serious.  You are not going to simply watch some videos and voila.. your a PyTorch expert.  Learning your way around the fastai API and finding the documentation, forums, etc. does take some exploring time, but it's fun when you have a destination and goal in mind.  I can see what I need. \r\n",

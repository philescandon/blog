Hi - I'm Phil from New England.  I'm a test engineer and a Aerospace firm.  I'm interested in using notebooks for documenation of tests and capturing all data possible for independent examination by any one.  I'm learning AI techniques with fastai.  I'm currently a Masters student at Boston University.
Cheers!
